# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Tracker ‚Äì A Full Stack MVP for Simplified Activity Logging

![Amiresponsive](assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

‚ÄúNot all metrics matter. Sometimes, the best data is the simplest.‚Äù  To visit the deployed version of the Activity Tracker [click here](https://reactivity-789dd5d26427.herokuapp.com/).

## 1. Purpose

The Activity Tracker saves the key details of a training or recreational activity  in the simplest, straightforward way. It is useful for anyone who wants to record their sport or recreational activities and wants to monitor their progress over time. Because of its simplicity, it doesn't create an overwhelming feeling in the user caused by too much and complicated data, instead bringing back the focus on the key thing, the training itself. There are far more advanced applications/ platforms out there, which provide a lot more details, which eventually become the problem. The users will focus much more on certain metrics, and when some targets are not met, it will have a negative impact on the users' behavior, motivation. Certainly, when one is competing for her/his country or doing competitive sports for a living, all the data is needed to make improvements. But for the majority few key details are enough to be healthy and create good habits. The Activity Tracker is a full-stack web application and was built using Django, Python, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, and React.

## 3.  Requirement Gathering and Planning

###  Project Summary
The activity tracker app was designed to help users record and monitor how they spend their time through a simple and user-friendly interface.
The goal of this project was to build an intuitive activity tracker app that allows users to log, manage, and review their daily/weekly activities. 
Planning focused on user needs such as accessibility, ease of use, and data accuracy.‚Äù
Platforms like [Strava](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/) and [Garmin](https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/activity-api/) are the giants. 
I drew inspiration from them but opted to avoid the complexities of their APIs and licenses. Both of those well-known platforms, at their core, have the same functionality that I wanted to have for the users.

**Strava**

![Strava Manual Activity](assets/images/stravamobile.jpg)

**Garmin**

![Garmin Manual Activity](assets/images/garmindesktop.png)

The main difference is that while they treat this feature as an add-on or extra, I want this feature to be the core of an activity tracker.
In case of future development, other functionalities would be added to this and not the other way round.

To keep it simple, I designed a **simplified user interface** to support key use cases:
-  Log activities with type, name, date, and duration
-  View records in a clean dashboard
-  Edit or delete records anytime

### Reusable React Components

To promote scalability, maintainability, and consistency across the frontend, the application was developed using modular and reusable React components. These components are divided by responsibility and reusability within the application interface.

---

#### 1. Page-Level Components
These components correspond to specific routes or views in the application:

- `HomePage`
- `LoginPage`
- `Register`
- `AboutPage`
- `DashboardPage`
- `ProfilePage`
- `NotFoundPage`

Each of these handles user-specific views, logic, and layout for a dedicated part of the application.

---

#### 2.  Layout and Navigation
These components manage the persistent UI structure and navigation:

- `Navbar`: Main navigation bar visible across authenticated views
- `Layout`: Shared page layout wrapper for protected routes
- `App`: The root-level component used for routing and app shell

---

#### 3.  Reusable UI Components
These are standalone components reused across multiple pages and forms:

- `ActivityForm`: Reusable form used for creating and editing activities
- `ActivityList`: Component that renders filtered or sorted lists of saved activities
- `ConfirmModal`: A generic confirmation modal used for delete actions

These are composable and used in different views like Dashboard, Edit, and Delete workflows.

---

#### 4.  Authentication and Context
These components manage authentication state and user context globally via React Context API:

- `AuthContext` / `AuthProvider`: Handles login state, token storage, and protected routing
- `UserContext` / `UserProvider`: Manages user profile data across the app

These ensure a consistent user experience and allow state sharing across components.

---

#### 5.  CRUD-Specific or Utility Components
These support specific operations but aren't tied to a single view:

- `DeleteActivity`: Component for confirming and performing delete actions
- `UpdateActivity`: Component used to handle updates to previously logged activities

These components extend the functionality of core screens like Dashboard and Profile, and promote the separation of concerns.

---

Together, these reusable components helped keep the codebase modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), simplifying development and making future updates easier to implement.
## 4. Testing

### Testing Strategy
This project followed a practical testing strategy combining both automated and manual testing. The goal was to ensure the core functionalities of the activity tracker remained reliable and user-friendly throughout development. Testing was applied to both frontend and backend components, with a focus on user-facing features like form validation and activity management.

---

### Continuous Testing
I employed a continuous testing approach by running validation steps on each commit. ESLint and Prettier were integrated locally to enforce code standards, and GitHub Actions were configured to run basic checks automatically during pull requests, helping catch syntax and logic issues early.

---

### Automated Testing
Automated tests were written to cover reusable frontend components and backend routes. 
- **Frontend**: Jest and React Testing Library were used to test UI rendering, input validation, and component logic.
- **Backend**: Unit tests for models and route handlers were written using `unittest` (or `pytest`, if using Python).
- Example: `npm test` or `pytest` to execute tests.
- The test file is located in /activitytracker/test.py.

---

### Manual Testing
Manual testing covered user flows such as registration, login/logout, adding/editing activities, and profile updates. Each major feature was tested on multiple browsers and devices to simulate real-world usage.
Common edge cases (e.g., empty form fields, invalid dates, short passwords) were manually triggered to validate error handling.

| Test Element    | The Test                                 | The Outcome                                             |

| Responsiveness  | Open site on mobile device               | ‚úÖ Pass: All functions accessible and readable          |

---

### Browser & Responsiveness
The application was manually tested for responsiveness and layout accuracy on the following environments:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Redmi Note 13, MacBook Pro, 13" Laptop, 27" Monitor
Media queries and flexible units were used to ensure consistent behavior across screen sizes.

---

### Code Validation
The codebase adheres to modern standards through regular linting and formatting tools:
- **HTML** validated with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS** formatted using Prettier
- **JavaScript** checked using ESLint (Airbnb style guide)

---

### Accessibility

Accessibility best practices were applied using:

- **Lighthouse Audits** to check color contrast and semantic HTML usage. I have recorded the final results for each page below:

---

## 5. Deployment

The application was deployed using **Heroku**, with the frontend and backend hosted as **separate apps** to maintain modularity and flexibility.

---

###  Backend Deployment (Django)

The Django API server is deployed independently, with proper environment variables and Heroku configurations for production.

#### Key Deployment Steps:
- Environment variables were set on Heroku:
  - `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
  - `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
  - `DATABASE_URL` and any storage service credentials (e.g., Cloudinary)

- Project was prepared using:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Deployed using:
  ```bash
  git push heroku-backend main
  heroku run python manage.py migrate 
  ```

---

###  Frontend Deployment (React)

The React frontend was built and deployed separately to a dedicated Heroku app.

#### Key Deployment Steps:
- Built using:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- `.env.production` configured with:
  ```env
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://activitytracking-bf7924cd3676.herokuapp.com/

- Deployed with:
  ```bash
  git push heroku-frontend main
  ```

---

###  Post-deployment Checklist

After both apps were deployed, the following checks were performed:

- Verified login, registration, and form submissions
- Tested links and page navigation
- Checked browser console for JS errors
- Verified API requests and CORS handling in the network tab
- Inspected live styling, image paths, and media responsiveness

---

###  Tips & Debugging

- Used `heroku logs --tail -activity-tracker` to monitor production logs
- Disable `DEBUG` mode and ensure no development tools are exposed

## 6.  Agile Methodology

This project followed a simplified Agile methodology to support iterative development and continuous improvement throughout the application's lifecycle. Development was managed using GitHub Projects, Issues, and a custom roadmap to organize tasks and track progress over time.

---

###  Workflow Approach

A **Kanban-style board** was used to track tasks through the following stages:
![Backlog](assets/images/backlog.png)

- **Backlog**: Initial ideas or planned features
- **In Progress**: Tasks being actively developed
- **Done**: Completed features or fixes
- **Won‚Äôt Have This Time**: Items intentionally deferred or de-scoped

Each issue represented a single task or user story, and many were linked to GitHub Milestones for sprint tracking.

---

###  Issue Prioritization

Tasks were organized using MoSCoW-style labels:
- **Must Have**: Critical to MVP (e.g., registration, login)
- **Should Have**: Valuable features but not core (e.g., delete/edit activity)
- **Could Have**: Optional improvements (e.g., activity search)
- **Won‚Äôt Have This Time**: Features to postpone (e.g., distance tracking)

This approach ensured clarity around scope and helped keep development focused and realistic.

---

###  Sprint and Timeline Tracking

The roadmap view showed a chronological rollout of tasks across May and June. Tasks like form validation, filtering, and core CRUD operations were distributed across the weeks and tracked by ID.

Notable features completed:
- Registration & Login flow
- Activity logging with type, date, and duration
- Activity list display with filters and search
- UI/UX improvements like password visibility toggle

---

###  Tools Used

- **GitHub Projects** for board-based issue tracking
- **GitHub Issues** to represent features and bugs
- **GitHub Roadmap** to visualize delivery timeline
- Manual sprint retrospectives to assess progress and re-prioritize

###¬†Lessons & Final Thoughts

This project taught me:

Full-stack coordination between frontend and backend

How tricky real-world deployments can get

Managing form data and authentication securely

Leveraging DRF with JWT for APIs

React component reuse and prop management

There is huge potential in full-stack applications, regardless of what it is for.
