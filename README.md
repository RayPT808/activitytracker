# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Tracker ‚Äì A Full Stack MVP for Simplified Activity Logging

![Amiresponsive](assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

‚ÄúNot all metrics matter. Sometimes, the best data is the simplest.‚Äù  To visit the deployed version of the Activity Tracker [click here](https://reactivity-789dd5d26427.herokuapp.com/).

## 1. Purpose

The Activity Tracker saves the key details of a training or recreactional activity  in the most simple, straightforward way. It is useful for anyone who wants to record their sport or recreational activities, and wants to monitor their progress over time. Because of it's simplicity it doesn't create an overwhelming feeling in the user caused by too much and complicated data, instead brings back the focus on the key thing, the training itself. There are far more advanced applications/ platforms out there, they provide a lot more details, which eventually becomes the problem. The usres will focus much more on certain metrics and when some targets are not met it will have a negative impact on the users' behavoiur, motivation. Certanly when one is competeing for her/his country or doing competitive sports for living all the data is needed to make improvements. But for the majority few key details are enough to be healthy and create good habits. The Activity Tracker is a full stack web application and was built using Django, Python, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, React.

## 3.  Requirement Gathering and Planning

###  Project Summary
The activity tracker app was designed to help users record and monitor how they spend their time through a simple and user-friendly interface.
The goal of this project was to build an intuitive activity tracker app that allows users to log, manage, and review their daily/weekly activities. 
Planning focused on user needs such as accessibility, ease of use, and data accuracy.‚Äù
Platforms like [Strava](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/) and [Garmin](https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/activity-api/) are the giants. 
I drew inspiration from them but opted to avoid the complexities of their APIs and licenses. Both of those well known platforms at their core have the same functionality that I wanted to have for the users.

**Strava**

![Strava Manual Activity](assets/images/stravamobile.jpg)

**Garmin**

![Garmin Manual Activity](assets/images/garmindesktop.png)

The main difference is that while they treat this feature as an add on or extra, I want this feature to be the core of an activity tracker.
In case of future development other functionalities would be added to this and not the other way round.

To keep it simple I designed a **simplified user interface** to support key use cases:
-  Log activities with type, name, date, and duration
-  View past records in a clean dashboard
-  Edit or delete records anytime

## 4. Testing

### Testing Strategy
This project followed a practical testing strategy combining both automated and manual testing. The goal was to ensure the core functionalities of the activity tracker remained reliable and user-friendly throughout development. Testing was applied to both frontend and backend components, with a focus on user-facing features like form validation and activity management.

---

### Continuous Testing
I employed a continuous testing approach by running validation steps on each commit. ESLint and Prettier were integrated locally to enforce code standards, and GitHub Actions was configured to run basic checks automatically during pull requests, helping catch syntax and logic issues early.

---

### Automated Testing
Automated tests were written to cover reusable frontend components and backend routes. 
- **Frontend**: Jest and React Testing Library were used to test UI rendering, input validation, and component logic.
- **Backend**: Unit tests for models and route handlers were written using `unittest` (or `pytest`, if using Python).
- Example: `npm test` or `pytest` to execute tests.
- Test file is located in /activitytracker/test.py.

---

### Manual Testing
Manual testing covered user flows such as registration, login/logout, adding/editing activities, and profile updates. Each major feature was tested on multiple browsers and devices to simulate real-world usage.
Common edge cases (e.g., empty form fields, invalid dates, short passwords) were manually triggered to validate error handling.

| Test Element    | The Test                                 | The Outcome                                             |

### Browser & Responsiveness
The application was manually tested for responsiveness and layout accuracy on the following environments:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Redmi Note 13, MacBook Pro, 13" Laptop, 27" Monitor
Media queries and flexible units were used to ensure consistent behavior across screen sizes.

---

### Code Validation
The codebase adheres to modern standards through regular linting and formatting tools:
- **HTML** validated with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS** formatted using Prettier
- **JavaScript** checked using ESLint (Airbnb style guide)

---

### Accessibility
Accessibility best practices were applied using:
- **Lighthouse Audits** to check color contrast and semantic HTML usage.  I have recorded the final results for each page below:

### Bugs and Fixes
During testing, several minor bugs were identified and resolved:
- [x] Prevented saving activities with duration `00:00:00`
- [x] Fixed broken image paths in `README.md`
- [x] Corrected input validation logic on registration form
All fixes were committed with descriptive messages and, where applicable, linked to specific issues or pull requests.

### User Experience

#### First time visitor goals

+ As a first time visitor the goal and the purpose of the website is easily understandable.

+ As a first time visitor I can easily navigate through the page and locate functions.

#### Returning visitor goals

+ After some contemplation as a returning visitor to the website I can find and carry out a registration.

+ As a registered user I can log in to my account, where my data and details are stored securely.

+ As a logged in user I can choose from different types of activities.

+ As a logged in user I can save my chosen actyvity type, date, duration.

#### Frequent user goals

+ As a frequently returning user I can see my past activities on a list.

+ As a frequently returning user I can modify details of past activities or I can delete past activities.



#### Browser compatibility

Tested the website on **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox**.
Appearance was good on all three browsers.
Intended responsiveness also good on all three.

![responsive](/assets/images/responsive.png)

#### Lighthouse report

Unfotunately based on the Lighthouse report, the website has poor performance with several issues.

![LighthouseReport](/assets/images/Lighthouse-Report.png)


#### Login credentials

+ Django admin - Username: Runner1  Password: Sunday12

### Acknowledgement

Grateful for the help and the input from my mentor **Iuliia Konovalova**.
She always gave a different perspective on the issues and with her experience
and eyes for details I was guided in the right direction to make this project happen.


###¬†Lessons & Final Thoughts

This project taught me:

Full-stack coordination between frontend and backend

How tricky real-world deployments can get

Managing form data and authentication securely

Leveraging DRF with JWT for APIs

React component reuse and prop management

There is a huge potential in full stack applications, regardless what is it for.
