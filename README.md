# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Tracker ‚Äì A Full Stack MVP for Simplified Activity Logging

![Activity Tracker](assets/images/Activity%20Tracker%20Logged%20in%20view.png)

> ‚ÄúNot all metrics matter. Sometimes, the best data is the simplest.‚Äù

##  Overview

As a personal trainer and hobby triathlete, I always try to keep track of my activities using platforms like **Strava** and **Garmin Connect**. While powerful, these tools often overwhelm with complex metrics. This app is a **minimal viable product (MVP)** built to address this: _track your activities simply and clearly_.

This is my fifth and final milestone project at Code Institute ‚Äì a **full stack web app** using **React**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL**, designed for everyday users who just want to log, view, and manage their activities.

##  The Vision

Platforms like [Strava](https://developers.strava.com/) and [Garmin](https://developer.garmin.com/) are the giants. I drew inspiration from them but opted to avoid the complexities of their APIs and licenses.

Instead, I designed a **simplified user interface** to support key use cases:
-  Log activities with type, name, date, and duration
-  View past records in a clean dashboard
-  Edit or delete records anytime

###  Manual Testing Table

| Feature             | Test Scenario                     | Expected Outcome                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Register new user   | Fill form and submit              | New account created, redirected    |
| Login with token    | Valid credentials                 | Token stored, redirect to dashboard |
| Add activity        | Fill all fields                   | Activity saved and appears in list |
| Edit activity       | Click Edit, update fields         | Changes saved                      |

##  Deployment

###  Backend (Django) ‚Äì Heroku

1. Create Heroku app & PostgreSQL DB
2. Add environment variables (`DEBUG=False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `SECRET_KEY`, etc.)
3. Update `settings.py`:
   - Add `whitenoise`, `corsheaders`
   - Setup `STATIC_ROOT`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, `Cloudinary`
4. Add `Procfile`:  
5. Push code to Heroku or GitHub ‚Üí Connect repo
6. Run:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser


### User Experience

#### First time visitor goals

+ As a first time visitor the goal and the purpose of the website is easily understandable.

+ As a first time visitor I can easily navigate through the page and locate functions.

#### Returning visitor goals

+ After some contemplation as a returning visitor to the website I can find and carry out a registration.

+ As a registered user I can log in to my account, where my data and details are stored securely.

+ As a logged in user I can choose from different types of activities.

+ As a logged in user I can save my chosen actyvity type, date, duration.

#### Frequent user goals

+ As a frequently returning user I can see my past activities on a list.

+ As a frequently returning user I can modify details of past activities or I can delete past activities.



#### Browser compatibility

Tested the website on **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox**.
Appearance was good on all three browsers.
Intended responsiveness also good on all three.

#### Lighthouse report

Unfotunately based on the Lighthouse report, the website has poor performance with several issues.

### Acknowledgement

Grateful for the help and the input from my mentor **Iuliia Konovalova**.
She always gave a different perspective on the issues and with her experience
and eyes for details I was guided in the right direction to make this project happen.


###¬†Lessons & Final Thoughts

This project taught me:

Full-stack coordination between frontend and backend

How tricky real-world deployments can get

Managing form data and authentication securely

Leveraging DRF with JWT for APIs

React component reuse and prop management

There is a huge potential in full stack applications, regardless what is it for.
